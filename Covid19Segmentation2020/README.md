### Results

The results obtained with the proposed approach were submitted multiple times at the challenge
[Validation phase](https://covid-segmentation.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/challenge/leaderboard/).
Moderate results were achieved at this stage with the highest result corresponded to 0.7173 mean Dice score.
The latest submit resulted in 0.7036 mean Dice and 86th position among 200+ submitted results.

During the [Test phase](https://covid-segmentation.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/challenge-second-phase-new-data/leaderboard/)
the proposed approach resulted in 0.6461 mean Dice which corresponded to 8th position among 98 submitted results for non-final ranking 
(see [vitali.liauchuk](https://grand-challenge.org/users/vitali.liauchuk/)).

Information about the final ranking will come soon.

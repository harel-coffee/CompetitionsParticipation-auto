### Structure

[Scripts](Scripts/README.md) folder contains the basic Python scripts for data processing and models training.

[data](data/README.md) folder will contain auxiliary data generated by the scripts.

### Running

Prior to running the scripts, the datasets provided by the organizers must be downloaded. 
Additionally, one should download the addotional version of lungs masks 
obtained via segmentation-through-registration scheme ([link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DKPcSQLZ-Ff7Xp2fSnc46O9cqLM24aV3/view?usp=sharing)).
For short description of the additional segmentation method see [this PDF](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1866/paper_146.pdf).

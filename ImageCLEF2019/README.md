# ImageCLEF2019

The repository contains scripts used upon participation in ImageCLEFtuberculosis 2019 challenge by [UIIP_BioMed](https://www.crowdai.org/participants/uiip_biomed).
The challenge was dedicated to the analysis of 3D Computed Tomography (CT) image data of tuberculosis (TB) patients.

* CT Report generation subtask (CTR): https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/imageclef-2019-tuberculosis-ct-report
* TB Severity scoring subtask (SVR): https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/imageclef-2019-tuberculosis-severity-scoring

### Structure

[Scripts](Scripts/) folder contains the basic Python scripts for data processing and models training.

[data](data/) folder will contain auxiliary data generated by the scripts.

### Running

Prior to running the scripts, the datasets provided by the organizers must be downloaded. 
Along with the lung masks provided by the organizers [1] in this study an additional lung segmentation was used. 
For short description of the additional segmentation method see [2].
The additional lungs masks were obtained via segmentation-through-registration scheme and are available for [download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DKPcSQLZ-Ff7Xp2fSnc46O9cqLM24aV3) (130 MB). Source codes imlpementing the segmentation method are [available on Github](https://github.com/skliff13/CT_RegSegm).

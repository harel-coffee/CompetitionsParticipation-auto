# Scripts

The scripts are not very well structurized and contain some auxiliary elements used for multiple try-and-fail runs.
Running the codes requires step-by-step manual control.

The key steps are described below.

### 1. Generating CT projections

The key point of the proposed approach is converting 3D CT scans into 2D projections. 
Projections are made along each axis (X, Y, Z) and for each lung (left/right) separately. 
Subsequently, the main image classification algorithms dealt with the generated 2D projections.

The projections are generated by [go_a_gen_lung_projections.py](go_a_gen_lung_projections.py). 
The script uses original images and the coresponding lung masks. 
The results are saved to `../data/clef_projections_v1.*`. 
With this study `clef_projections_v1.0` were generated using  lung masks provided by the organizers ([default](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yashin_Dicente_Cid/publication/278031286_Efficient_and_fully_automatic_segmentation_of_the_lungs_in_CT_volumes/links/557aa1ac08ae753637571d22/Efficient-and-fully-automatic-segmentation-of-the-lungs-in-CT-volumes.pdf)), 
`v1.1` were generated using the additional masks ([registration-based]
(https://github.com/skliff13/CompetitionsParticipation/blob/master/ImageCLEF2019/README.md)), 
and `v1.2` were generated using the default masks and high intensity threshold (+1000 HU) to catch calcifications.

The examples of X, Y and Z projections for left lung of CTR_TRN_001 are shown below.

### 2. Training Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) for binary lung classification

Here, a CNN is trained to recognize a 2D lung projection image as either healthy ("normal") or affected by TB ("abnormal"). 
The ground truth information for each lung is given in `CTR_LeftLungAffected` and `CTR_RightLungAffected` metadata fields.
Splitting development data into training and validation subsets is done by [go_b_train_val_split.py](go_b_train_val_split.py).
Network training process is launched with [go_c_train_lung_binary.py](go_c_train_lung_binary.py).

The network model was trained for over 120 epochs using `v1.0` lung projections.
Accuracy and Loss plots are shown below. "Normal"/"abnormal" prediction on the validation subset resulted in 0.865 AUC value.

### 3. Training CNNs for detection of Caverns and LungCapacityDecrease

All other labels (`LungCapacityDecrease`, `Calcification`, `Pleurisy` and `Caverns`) are specified at CT-level, without  information about the specific lung (left/right/both) having aech label. 
CNNs were used to detect `LungCapacityDecrease` and `Caverns`.
In this case, the input for the CNN is composed of projections of two lungs, `v1.1` projections were used at this stage. 

Weights of the convolutional layers were initialized with the corresponding weights of the CNN previously trained for "normal"/"abnormal" classification.
Training process is lauched with [go_d_train_ct_report_binary.py](go_d_train_ct_report_binary.py) script.
Network for `LungCapacityDecrease` was trained for 50 epochs (validation AUC = 0.832), network for `Caverns` was trained for 120 epochs (validation AUC = 0.809).

### 4. Assessing scores for Calcification and Pleurisy

`Calcification` and `Pleurisy` were detected using pretty simple ways. 

Scores for prediction of `Calcification` were calculated as mean intensity value of `v1.2` projections which reflects the number of voxels exceeding 1000 HU threshold (see [aux_explore_calcifications.py](aux_explore_calcifications.py)).
Evaluation on the training subset resulted in 0.719 AUC value. 

Scores for detection of `Pleurisy` were calculated as difference between the volumes of lungs segmented via two different approaches: default and registration-based (see [aux_test_pleurisy.py](aux_test_pleurisy.py)). 
Evaluation on the development (train + val) dataset resulted in 0.776 AUC.

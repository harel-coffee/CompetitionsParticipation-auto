# Scripts

The scripts are not very well structurized and contain some auxiliary elements used for multiple try-and-fail runs.

### Generating CT projections

The key point of the proposed approach is converting 3D CT scans into 2D projections. Projections are made along each axis (X, Y, Z) and for each lung (left/right) separately. Subsequently, the main image classification algorithms dealt with the generated 2D projections.

The projections are generated by [go_a_gen_lung_projections.py](go_a_gen_lung_projections.py). The script uses original images and the coresponding lung masks. The results are saved to `../data/clef_projections_v1.*`. With this study `clef_projections_v1.0` were generated using  lung masks provided by the organizers (default), `*v1.1` were generated using the additional masks ([registration-based](https://github.com/skliff13/CompetitionsParticipation/blob/master/ImageCLEF2019/README.md)), and `*v1.2` were generated using the default masks and high intensity threshold (+1000 HU) to catch calcifications.

The examples of X, Y and Z projections for left lung of CTR_TRN_001 are shown below.
